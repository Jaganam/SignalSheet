**Singal Sheet** is a tool I developed to assist founders and operators in their confidence going into their for 1:1s with their team leads with organized, prepared, and clarified priorities.

**Inspiration**

This project started as an attempt to bring more structure to the way founders prepare for 1:1s, something I've always naturally gravitated toward. I have a strong organizational instinct, and I've seen how much leverage can be unlocked by simply showing up to conversations with clarity about what's open, what's blocked, and what decisions are pending.
This project is a result of stepping outside of my usual tools and bulding something that reflects how I think. Structure creates focus, and systems create momentum. I wanted to create a workflow that helps a founder operate with more deliberation in fast-moving environments. 

**How it Works**

This tool turns unstructured prep notes and loose ideas into a categorized brief with the following identifiers:

- Top Priorities
- Blockers
- Open Threads
- Decisions
- Watch For

To run the program:

- Add your weekly prep notes to the *1on1_input.txt* file.
- Run the program (it will parse the file)
- Your structured brief will be produced in a file *signal_sheet.md*.

Sample Input:

Maya â€“ Engineering
Top of mind: Backend instability after last deploy is raising internal concerns
Blockers: No final decision on database vendor and QA automation is behind
Open threads: DevX feedback from test suite still unaddressed
Decisions: Finalize choice between Planetscale and Supabase
Watch: Latency spikes on US-East workloads

Jordan â€“ GTM
Top of mind: Trial signups spiked post-Product Hunt
Blockers: No clear tracking on user conversion flow
Open threads: Follow-up with Dovetail on partnership scope
Decisions: Adjust trial limits or wait for usage signal
Watch: Drop in weekly signups and high churn on day two

Expected Output:
# Signal Sheet â€“ Weekly 1:1 Brief

### ðŸ”” Open Decisions Summary
- Maya: Finalize choice between Planetscale and Supabase
- Jordan: Adjust trial limits or wait for usage signal

## Jordan â€“ GTM
**Top of Mind**  
Trial signups spiked post-Product Hunt, unclear if theyâ€™re converting

**Blockers**  
No clear tracking on user conversion flow

**Open Threads**  
Follow-up with Dovetail on partnership scope

**Decisions Needed**  
Adjust trial limits or wait for usage signal
